### Exploratory analysis of the analytic sample

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(rio,
       tidyverse)

hrs_merged <- import("hrs_merged.rds")

#create analytic sample
hrs <- hrs_merged %>% 
  filter(as_numeric(dod_yr) >= 2012 | is.na(dod_yr)) %>% #remove cases deceased prior to 2012
  select(hhidpn, 
         study, race_ethn, sex, birthyr, year,
         cogfunction,
         ad_pgs, starts_with("pc"),
         incar_ever,
         stroke_ever,
         apoe_info99_4ct,
         social_origins,
         ses) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

Let's see what years we're working with.
