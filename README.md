This repo hosts the code for the analysis of the (in process) article examining the impact of incarceration on the genetic association of a polygenic index (PGI) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive status in later life. The article uses evolutionary gerontology to inform its approach and tests its assumptions and predictions using two datasets: the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Longtiudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). 
 
 Keywords: Evolutionary gerontology; pains of imprisonment; importation; Alzheimer's disease; polygenic prediction
